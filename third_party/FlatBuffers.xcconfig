// FlatBuffers Build Configuration
// Header-only C++ library for serialization
// Version: v25.12.19 (git submodule)

// Projects are in iMuJoCo/{app,core,render}/, so ../../third_party/ goes to root third_party/

// Generated schema headers - fixed location in build/ (like mujoco.xcframework)
// Generated by flatbuffers-codegen aggregate target

// Add to header search paths (same for all platforms - header-only)
